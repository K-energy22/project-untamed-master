FAQ:
Q: What is Dexit? What do you mean "Dexit done right"?
A: Dexit is a nickname for SwSh's very controversial decision to not have all Pokémon in the dex.
   We aim to introduce new life into both competitive and in-game player experience by not having the usual 'old reliables'; 
   this means we will avoid adding Pokémon that are overused. (Eg: no Volcarona; no Garchomp; no Ferrothorn; no Toxapex; list goes on)
   with the intent of incentivizing the usage of often looked down Pokémon.

Q: Will you add X mon?
A: It depends if it fits Mazah and if its introduction won't overshadow other Pokémon. *However*, if X mon is 
       a. A legendary from another region
	   b. A starter from another region
	   c. A regional from another region
	   d. Anything post SwSh
   they will not be considered. (RIP Mudkip)

Q: Generational Gimmick?
A: NO DMAX, NO Z-Moves, NO Agile / Strong Style. Yes Megas! the only good generational gimmick. :)

Q: Will there be more versions?
A: No. One version, with all the content.
